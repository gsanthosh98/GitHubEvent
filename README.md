# Prerequisites
1. Install Git in your machine. Follow the instructions in this [link](https://gist.github.com/sbenstewart/34b9629976ab85094f476b8277078208).
2. Have a text editor of your choice. I prefer [Atom](https://atom.io/). Even the CommandPrompt or the Terminal is fine.
3. Bringing a <b>fully charged laptop</b> with the charging cable if needed would help you get the most out of the session.
